MASYU examples

- All files, except masyu00.txt, have a unique solution. You must check that your encoding generates a unique solution using:

clingo 0 masyuKB.lp masyuXX.lp

- File masyu00.txt has no circles and corresponds to a 3 x 3 empty grid. Your encoding should be able to generate 14 possible solutions that correspond to all the possible closed loops that can be formed (including the "empty" loop with no edges).

- The grid sizes in each example are:

masyu01.txt	3
masyu02.txt	6
masyu03.txt	6
masyu04.txt	8
masyu05.txt	10
masyu06.txt	15
